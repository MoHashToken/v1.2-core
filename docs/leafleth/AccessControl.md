# AccessControl
> 
```

```




### ðŸ”Ž Details

Contract module that allows children to implement role-based access control mechanisms. This is a lightweight version that doesn&#39;t allow enumerating role members except through off-chain means by accessing the contract event logs. Some applications may benefit from on-chain enumerability, for those cases see {AccessControlEnumerable}. Roles are referred to by their `bytes32` identifier. These should be exposed in the external API and be unique. The best way to achieve this is by using `public constant` hash digests: ``` bytes32 public constant MY_ROLE = keccak256(&quot;MY_ROLE&quot;); ``` Roles can be used to represent a set of permissions. To restrict access to a function call, use {hasRole}: ``` function foo() public {     require(hasRole(MY_ROLE, msg.sender));     ... } ``` Roles can be granted and revoked dynamically via the {grantRole} and {revokeRole} functions. Each role has an associated admin role, and only accounts that have a role&#39;s admin role can call {grantRole} and {revokeRole}. By default, the admin role for all roles is `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`, which means that only accounts with this role will be able to grant or revoke other roles. More complex role relationships can be created by using {_setRoleAdmin}. WARNING: The `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` is also its own admin: it has permission to grant and revoke this role. Extra precautions should be taken to secure accounts that have been granted it.

### â†’ Returns



| Name | Type |
|:-:|:-:|
|  Not specified  | `bytes32` |



## `supportsInterface`

>ðŸ‘€ `view`



### ðŸ”Ž Details

See {IERC165-supportsInterface}.

### â†’ Returns



| Name | Type |
|:-:|:-:|
|  Not specified  | `bool` |



## `hasRole`

>ðŸ‘€ `view`



### ðŸ”Ž Details

Returns `true` if `account` has been granted `role`.

### â†’ Returns



| Name | Type |
|:-:|:-:|
|  Not specified  | `bool` |



## `getRoleAdmin`

>ðŸ‘€ `view`



### ðŸ”Ž Details

Returns the admin role that controls `role`. See {grantRole} and {revokeRole}. To change a role&#39;s admin, use {_setRoleAdmin}.

### â†’ Returns



| Name | Type |
|:-:|:-:|
|  Not specified  | `bytes32` |



## `grantRole`

>ðŸ‘€ `nonpayable`



### ðŸ”Ž Details

Grants `role` to `account`. If `account` had not been already granted `role`, emits a {RoleGranted} event. Requirements: - the caller must have ``role``&#39;s admin role.



## `revokeRole`

>ðŸ‘€ `nonpayable`



### ðŸ”Ž Details

Revokes `role` from `account`. If `account` had been granted `role`, emits a {RoleRevoked} event. Requirements: - the caller must have ``role``&#39;s admin role.



## `renounceRole`

>ðŸ‘€ `nonpayable`



### ðŸ”Ž Details

Revokes `role` from the calling account. Roles are often managed via {grantRole} and {revokeRole}: this function&#39;s purpose is to provide a mechanism for accounts to lose their privileges if they are compromised (such as when a trusted device is misplaced). If the calling account had been revoked `role`, emits a {RoleRevoked} event. Requirements: - the caller must be `account`.
